# TS Node Quickstarter

A repo with ts-node, eslint, and prettier preconfigured to get started right away.
This is not supposed to be a template for a project, but rather an already set up environment to write some small snippets or test stuff out.

## Usage

Use `npm run start` or `npm run dev` to run a script.

```sh
npm run start src/example.ts
```
